// Similiar to matches.js.However, this page instead has direct input into the paragraphs along with data from the API. as a result, despite much testing, I could only implement this by making differnt writeToDoucument functions for
// each player, the only difference being the player variable value changing and the static information I wrote inside the P tags. Maybe there is a way around this, but after hours of testing and trying different things this is what I could do.
// Ideally, I'd like to reuse the functions similiar to the switch statement in matches.js. When I tried to enter information into a p tag on the html page, it was removed once the JS loaded from stats.js.
